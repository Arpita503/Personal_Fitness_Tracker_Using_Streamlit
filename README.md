# Personal_Fitness_Tracker_Using_Streamlit

Overview

The Personal Fitness Tracker is a Python-based application designed to help users track their fitness progress by predicting calorie expenditure, analyzing workout efficiency, and providing exercise recommendations. It utilizes machine learning techniques to offer personalized insights based on user-specific parameters such as age, BMI, workout duration, heart rate, and body temperature.

Features

Calorie Prediction: Uses a trained machine learning model (Random Forest Regressor) to estimate calorie burn.

Data Visualization: Displays fitness insights through interactive charts.

Workout Recommendations: Provides exercise suggestions based on user input.

User-friendly Interface: Built using Streamlit for easy interaction.

System Design

The system follows a structured pipeline:

Data Preprocessing: Cleans and merges exercise and calorie datasets.

Feature Engineering: Derives features like BMI for better predictions.

Machine Learning Model: Implements a Random Forest Regressor for calorie estimation.

Visualization & UI: Uses Streamlit to present results in a user-friendly manne
